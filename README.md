## üî• About Me

I am a passionate **Robotics Engineer** with deep expertise in **advanced perception, multi-robot coordination, reinforcement learning, and control systems**. My academic journey‚Äîearning an **M.S. in Robotics & Autonomous Systems** from ASU and a **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering** from Manipal Institute of Technology‚Äîhas provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics, control theory, kinematics, and dynamics. These skills are crucial for designing and deploying real-world autonomous systems.

I have refined my abilities through diverse hands-on projects and research, including:
- **Robotics Projects and research during my M.Sc. Robotics and Autonomous Systems at ASU**
- **Research at LOGOS Robotics Lab: ( 2025 Jan onwards )**  
  Under Prof. Nakul Gopalan, I contributed to a *shared action space for human‚Äìrobot collaboration* by combining skill learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.



I thrive on integrating robotics software with cutting-edge mechanical design to create transformative solutions that push the boundaries of autonomous systems.
